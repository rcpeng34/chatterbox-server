#chatterbox-server

This is a copy of the work I did on a private repo, originally a project from
[Hack Reactor's](http://hackreactor.com) curriculum. This project was worked
on with a pair; it's representative of the kind of problems that I've tackled,
but not of my solo work.

This implementation includes a somewhat unstable express implementation alongside a nodejs implementation.
Quickly hacked together to support a followup sprint. Apologies for the rush job.

NOTES:

Remember, you must run bower and npm install.
Additionally, your port might be taken so if necessary there is a portNum variable in app.js and basic-server.js for you to modify.
**Make sure the portNum variable found in the top of the ./client/scripts/app.js and ./server/basic-server.js files match.**
**Otherwise it will break and you will cry tears of unexpected errors**
